## UX 

### User stories

HOMEPAGE

* As a user I want the page to be easy to navigate.
* As a user I want to know what the site is about so I know what to expect from it.


# Features #
## Navigation ##
* The navigation is in a font that is modern and a color that contrasts with the background.
* The navigation clearly tells the user the name of the gamme and makes the different sections of information easy to find.
## The Header ## 
* The header explains the name of the game.

## Future Features ##

* In the future I would like to add more versions.

# Typography and color scheme #
